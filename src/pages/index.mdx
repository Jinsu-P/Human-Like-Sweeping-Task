## Abstract

This study proposes a trajectory modeling framework using user-demonstrated motion for collaborative robots to perform human-like sweeping tasks. By collecting the robot's motion data through a remote controller, we modeled the sweeping motion with a polynomial dynamical system (PLYDS). Additionally, we used large language models (LLMs) to specify sweeping tasks via natural language. Our framework allows users to adjust the robot's behavior without requiring any programming or domain expertise. Experimental results using an industrial collaborative robot demonstrated that the proposed approach not only produced human-like sweeping motions, but also enabled non-expert users to operate the system intuitively.

## Motivation

Sweeping tasks in outdoor environments such as road cleaning and industrial complexes are essential for ensuring worker safety and maintaining public hygiene. However, due to challenging weather conditions, the risk of traffic accidents, insufficient protective equipment, and a shortage of labor, such tasks are often hazardous and difficult for humans to perform directly.
As a result, there is a growing need to automate these operations using collaborative robots.
In particular, a teleoperation-based, programming-less framework is required to enable non-expert users to intuitively control the robot.
In our previous study, we proposed a **waypoint-based trajectory generation algorithm using a handheld controller and a mobile application**.
Usability evaluations demonstrated the effectiveness of this method in improving the accessibility of collaborative robot control. However, the approach was limited in its ability to express diverse motions and lacked flexibility in adapting to dynamic envirionment changes.
To address these limitations, the present study proposes a framework that enables collaborative robots to perform sweeping tasks more naturally and realistically by **modeling human motion using a Polynomial Dynamical System (PLYDS)** and supporting intuitive **trajectory modification through a Large Language Model (LLM)-based** natrual language interface.

## Experiments

We used a 6-DoF robot (Neuromeka Indy7) and a remote controller (HTC Vive Pro Controller) to collect 100 sweeping demonstrations, which were then used to train the PLYDS model.

## Figures

Use the figure component to display images, videos, equations, or any other element, with an optional caption.

## Image comparison slider

An interactive, accessible slider component with keyboard navigation.

## Two columns

Use the two columns component to display two columns of content. In this example, the first column contains a figure with a YouTube video and the second column contains a figure with a custom [React](https://react.dev/) component. By default, they display side by side, but if the screen is narrow enough (for example, on mobile), they're arranged vertically.

## Heading levels

Use headings to divide your content into sections.

### Heading 3

Go down a level to heading 3...

#### Heading 4

...and down again to heading 4.

## LaTeX

You can also add LaTeX formulas, rendered during the build process using [KaTeX](https://katex.org/) so they're quick to load for visitors of your project page. You can write them inline, like this: <LaTeX inline formula="a^2 + b^2 = c^2" />. Or, you can write them as a block:

<LaTeX formula="\int_a^b f(x) dx" />


## Tables

You can add simple tables using [GitHub Flavored Markdown syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/organizing-information-with-tables):

| Model | Accuracy | F1 score | Training time (hours) |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| BERT-base | 0.89 | 0.87 | 4.5 |
| RoBERTa-large | 0.92 | 0.91 | 7.2 |
| DistilBERT | 0.86 | 0.84 | 2.1 |
| XLNet | 0.90 | 0.89 | 6.8 |
